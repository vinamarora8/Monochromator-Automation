# Monochromator-Automation

### TODO
- [x] StepperMotor library
- [x] RotaryEncoder library
- [x] Spectrometer
- [x] Control
- [x] Callibrate
- [ ] Improve logic - Include angle restriction
- [x] Final Integration (Single program for Call and Cont)
- [ ] Installation File

This repository includes the code to automate Monochromator (a mechanical machine) using an Arduino, a Stepper motor, a Rotary encode and a Spectrometer.
The code is divided into 2 parts:
- Control : The program which will control an already caliberated Monochromator
- Calibrate : The program which will calibrate the Monochromator using a Spectrometer

## RotaryEncoder
This is an Arduino library to interface with a Rotary Encoder that gives its output in Gray Code.

## StepperControl

## Control
